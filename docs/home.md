## Want to try out the plugins?
My server, `play.ecomc.net`, runs all the eco plugins so you can see how they integrate with your server and each other. Have a look around!

## Where should I buy the plugins?
All plugins are available on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/auxilor.507394/) and [Polymart](https://polymart.org/user/auxilor.1107), and you can buy plugins at a 25% discount in a bundle, too - [click here to get them!](https://polymart.org/bundle/eco-pack.110)
