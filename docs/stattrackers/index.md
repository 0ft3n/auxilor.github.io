## What are Stat Trackers?

Stat Trackers are cosmetic upgrades to items that track stats related to specific tools, weapons, and armor pieces. It's perfect as an EULA-Friendly item to put in crates, and can lead to competition between players to have the highest stats on their items.

You can apply stat trackers by holding an item and running `/stattrackers`, and then dropping as many trackers as you want into the GUI!
