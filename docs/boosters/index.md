## What is Boosters?

Boosters are rewards purchased by a player, and then activated to give rewards to the whole server at once. For example, you can make a 1.5x Sell Multiplier booster that lasts and hour, which will increase everyone's sell prices for that time. It's perfect as an EULA-Friendly item to sell in your store, because no single player is getting a competitive advantage.

You can make your own boosters in config, or use the boosters that come with the plugin. Every single aspect of the plugin is completely customisable for you to play with - if you think a booster that does something should exist, you can make it in minutes.

A player can activate a booster by opening the GUI with `/boosters`
